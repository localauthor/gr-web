      <description>This is a personal and professional webpage. (I am a personal and a professional person.)
I teach American literature at Vilnius University.
I try to improve my classes, my research, and my personal brand, as I can.
I recently finished a dissertation on literatureâ€™s intersection with geographic knowledge-production in nineteenth-century America. It features chapters on Charles Brockden Brown, Margaret Fuller, and Emily Dickinson.
I take photographs. I sometimes post here.</description>
