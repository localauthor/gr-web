      <description>This is a personal and professional webpage. I am a personal and professional person.
I am currently teaching American literature at Vilnius University.
I am always working on improving my classes, my research, and my personal brand.
I have recently finished a dissertation on literatureâ€™s intersection with geographic knowledge-production in nineteenth-century America. It features chapters on Charles Brockden Brown, Margaret Fuller, and Emily Dickinson.
I used to take photographs. I am interested in being better at computers.</description>
